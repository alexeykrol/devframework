# Active Context

## Current Focus
The immediate focus is establishing the **Memory Bank** documentation structure to better organize the project context. The user has specifically requested the creation of this memory bank without making any code changes to the project itself yet.

## Recent Changes
- Created `memory-bank/projectbrief.md`
- Created `memory-bank/productContext.md`
- Created `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`
- Created `memory-bank/techContext.md`

## Active Decisions
- **Documentation First**: We are prioritizing documenting the existing system state before proceeding with any implementation or modification tasks.
- **Language**: The user communicates in Russian, so interactive responses will be in Russian, while the documentation artifacts are being kept in English (as per the existing project structure and standard practice, though this can be adapted if requested).

## Next Steps
1. Complete the memory bank initialization (`activeContext.md` and `progress.md`).
2. Confirm with the user that the documentation structure is satisfactory.
3. Await further instructions on specific devframework tasks or modifications.
