# Progress

## Status Overview
The project is in a stable state with core orchestration features implemented. We are currently enhancing the project's documentation by establishing a **Memory Bank** to support ongoing development and maintenance.

## Completed Features
- [x] Basic Orchestrator implementation (`orchestrator.py`)
- [x] Task template system (`framework/tasks/`)
- [x] Git worktree management logic
- [x] Basic logging and reporting
- [x] Legacy migration workflow support
- [x] Autonomous protocols documentation (`claude-code/`)

## In Progress
- [x] **Memory Bank Initialization**
  - [x] `projectbrief.md`
  - [x] `productContext.md`
  - [x] `systemPatterns.md`
  - [x] `techContext.md`
  - [x] `activeContext.md`
  - [x] `progress.md` (this file)

## Backlog / Planned
- [ ] Implement higher levels of autonomy defined in `claude-code/`
- [ ] Enhance error handling and "watchdog" capabilities
- [ ] Add more sophisticated integration tests
- [ ] Refine the multi-agent handoff process based on real-world usage data

## Known Issues
- _None critical at this documentation stage._
